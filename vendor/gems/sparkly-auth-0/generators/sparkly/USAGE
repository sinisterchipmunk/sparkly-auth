Description:
    Generates the various aspects of Sparkly Authentication:
    
    1. After you've created the model or models on which you wish to
       authenticate users, you should generate your configuration:
       
         script/generate sparkly config
          
    2. After editing the generated configuration file to match your
       goals, you should generate the necessary database migrations:
        
         script/generate sparkly migrations
       
    3. Other interesting generators:
        
         script/generate sparkly controllers
           Generates resource controllers for each authenticated
           model, which you can modify independently. Also generates
           the corresponding views, giving you maximum customization
           of your app. Not required.
           
         script/generate sparkly views
           Generates views for the authenticated models which you
           can then modify independently. Not required.
