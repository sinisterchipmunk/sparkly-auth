<p>
Rails authentication &#8212; with sparkles!
</p>
<h2>about the gem</h2>
<p>
After playing with a bunch of other auth gems out there, in the end I
decided I had to roll my own. Unlike the others (and the reason I undertook
this task), Sparkly <a href="../classes/Auth.html">Auth</a> errs on the
side of security. By default, (that is, unless you go changing
configuration options that water down its auth mechanisms), this gem
produces a PCI/DSS- compliant authentication scheme which I&#8216;m now
putting to work at my Real Job at Ingenico (<a
href="http://www.ingenico.com">www.ingenico.com</a>). (We now have two
Web-based payment applications depending on Sparkly <a
href="../classes/Auth.html">Auth</a>.)
</p>
<p>
There is an ongoing battle between security and convenience. They say you
can pick one, but not both. While I&#8216;m not going to claim that Sparkly
singlehandedly settles this dispute, I will say that Sparkly lets you
choose between varying shades of gray, rather than choosing between black
and white. Sparkly <a href="../classes/Auth.html">Auth</a> provides a
plethora of configuration options to let you apply a more user-friendly
authentication solution to your site, while making it crystal clear what
the security tradeoff will be.
</p>
<p>
Sparkly supports multiple user models, multiple controllers, and all that
jazz &#8212; but doesn&#8216;t force it on you. A default value is provided
for virtually every possible option, and the options are conveniently
tucked away in the class documentation &#8212; there for you when you need
it, but not breathing down your neck when you don&#8216;t.
</p>
<h3>what does security mean?</h3>
<p>
So that&#8216;s the high level overview. If you&#8216;ve read this far then
maybe you&#8216;re wondering exactly what kind of authentication security
Sparkly <a href="../classes/Auth.html">Auth</a> brings to the table. Well,
here&#8216;s The List. Some other solutions out there cover portions of it;
others cover other portions. But I&#8216;ve yet to find one (besides
Sparkly) that does it all.
</p>
<p>
One last disclaimer: all of this can be modified or disabled entirely. So
don&#8216;t think that because it&#8216;s listed here, dependencies HAVE to
use it. I&#8216;ve got a number of side apps written that use Sparkly but,
for example, completely disable the password update policy.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforces a strong password policy by default (7-digit uppercase, lowercase
and numeric)

</li>
<li>Enforces a periodic password update (once every 30 days)

</li>
<li>Enforces a unique password (can&#8216;t match any of the previous 4
passwords by default)

</li>
<li>Automatically signs the user out after 30 minutes of inactivity

</li>
<li>Provides secure single-access tokens for authentication without cookies
(e.g. Web Service consumers)

</li>
<li>Locks an account for 30 minutes after 5 invalid login attempts

</li>
<li>Provides generators for controllers and views, so that you can add (or
remove) layers quickly and painlessly &#8212; even on a per-model or
per-controller basis, if your application uses more than one

</li>
<li>Allows you to change which parent controller has access to the logged-in
user (defaults to ApplicationController)

</li>
<li>Behaviors (including even the core behavior) are plug-and-play and can be
easily swapped in/out, and custom behaviors can be added

</li>
<li>Encryption methods can be easily replaced

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since my own personal use cases for Sparkly <a
href="../classes/Auth.html">Auth</a> vary widely, so do its capabilities.
Not only can the above be disabled, but it also sports (for example) a
&quot;Remember Me&quot; checkbox that would otherwise circumvent some of
the above precautions. Obviously, the checkbox is disabled by default.
</p>
<h2>installation</h2>
<p>
In Rails 2, add &quot;sparkly-auth&quot; to your gem dependencies:
</p>
<pre>
  config.gem 'sparkly-auth'
</pre>
<p>
In Rails 3, add &quot;sparkly-auth&quot; to your Gemfile:
</p>
<pre>
  gem 'sparkly-auth'
</pre>
<h2>setting up</h2>
<p>
For a step-by-step guide, run
</p>
<pre>
  script/generate sparkly help
</pre>
<p>
Basically, the you have to run
</p>
<pre>
  script/generate sparkly config
  script/generate sparkly migrations
</pre>
<p>
and optionally (if you plan to override the controllers and/or views),
</p>
<pre>
  script/generate sparkly controllers
  script/generate sparkly views
</pre>
<p>
Assuming you have a User model (or that you&#8216;ve edited
config/initializers/sparkly_authentication.rb to taste), you should be
ready to go!
</p>
<p>
You should take a quick gander at
config/initializers/sparkly_authentication.rb just to see what&#8216;s in
there.
</p>
<h2>routes</h2>
<p>
Unless you disable them, Sparkly <a href="../classes/Auth.html">Auth</a>
will automatically generate a set of routes for its controllers. Run
</p>
<pre>
  rake routes
</pre>
<p>
and you should see something like this:
</p>
<pre>
   new_user_session GET    /user/session/new(.:format)
  edit_user_session GET    /user/session/edit(.:format)
       user_session GET    /user/session(.:format)
                    PUT    /user/session(.:format)
                    DELETE /user/session(.:format)
                    POST   /user/session(.:format)
         user_login        /user/login
        user_logout        /user/logout
           new_user GET    /user/new(.:format)
          edit_user GET    /user/edit(.:format)
               user GET    /user(.:format)
                    PUT    /user(.:format)
                    DELETE /user(.:format)
                    POST   /user(.:format)
                           /:controller/:action/:id
                           /:controller/:action/:id(.:format)
</pre>
<p>
This assumes you&#8216;re authenticating against a single User model.
Obviously, if you&#8216;re authenticating against a different model (or
more than one), the routes will be changed to suit.
</p>
<h2>migration</h2>
<p>
I&#8216;m working on rake tasks that help you migrate from other
authentication solutions to Sparkly <a
href="../classes/Auth.html">Auth</a>, largely because I had to do so
myself. So without further ado, here&#8216;s how you can do that:
</p>
<h3>Authlogic</h3>
<p>
After running the various Sparkly migrations, simply run:
</p>
<pre>
  rake auth:migrate:authlogic
</pre>
<p>
Done.
</p>
<p>
If you&#8216;ve set up an Authlogic encryptor other than SHA512,
you&#8216;ll want to use that encryptor for Sparkly. In this case,
don&#8216;t disable Authlogic the dependency (but DO remove the various
hooks from your code), and in your
config/initializers/sparkly_authentication.rb file, add the following line:
</p>
<pre>
  config.encryptor = Authlogic::CryptoProviders::Wordpress # or whatever.
</pre>
<p>
That should be it (it was for me). If you have any troubles, drop me a line
so I can update this documentation!
</p>
<h2>Note on Patches/Pull Requests</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fork the project.

</li>
<li>Make your feature addition or bug fix.

</li>
<li>Add tests for it. This is important so I don&#8216;t break it in a future
version unintentionally.

</li>
<li>Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to
have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself
I can ignore when I pull)

</li>
<li>Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

</li>
</ul>
