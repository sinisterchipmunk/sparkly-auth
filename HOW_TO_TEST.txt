There are 2 Gemfiles associated with this project:

  Gemfile.rails2
    pulls in all the gems needed to test in a Rails 2.x environment.
    
  Gemfile.rails3 
    pulls in all the gems needed to test in a Rails 3.x environment.
    
You can switch between them with the BUNDLE_GEMFILE environment
setting:

  export BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/Gemfile.rails2
  
By default, if BUNDLE_GEMFILE isn't set when `rake` is invoked,
`rake` will invoke itself twice -- once for each Gemfile -- and
this will result in running all tests for both Rails 2 and Rails 3.

NOTE that `bundle exec rake` only works if BUNDLE_GEMFILE
is set, otherwise Bundler won't know which Gemfile to load.

Once you're testing against the proper Rails, just invoke the 
Rakefile like so:

  rake          # runs the specs and, if they're green, runs cucumber
  rake spec     # runs the specs only
  rake cucumber # runs cucumber only
